# Reset Glitch Hack 3 Phat QSB v1
Reset Glitch Hack 3 Phat Quick Solder Board v1

First pcb I've designed very simple but learned a bit about Fusio360 and pcb design in general.

PLL and DB1F1 pads along with D1F1 anchor point.

0805 SMD Resistor 1-10k recommended.


Qsb v107_2022-04-18.zip is the Gerber Output

RGH3 Phat QSB v1.zip is a .brd file

Will keep editing the file a bit but here is what created so far.
